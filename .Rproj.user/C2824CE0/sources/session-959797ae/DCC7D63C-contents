Leave-one-out cross-validation for the GW\eqn{\alpha}R model
}

\description{
Leave-one-out cross-validation for the GW\eqn{\alpha}R model
}

\usage{
cv.gwar(y, x, a = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), coords, h,
nfolds = 10, size = 1000, folds = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{
A matrix with compositional data. zero values are allowed.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with the continuous predictor variables or a data frame including categorical predictor variables.
}
\item{a}{
The value of the power transformation, it has to be between -1 and 1. If zero values are present it has to be greater than 0. If \eqn{\alpha=0} the isometric log-ratio transformation is applied.
}
\item{coords}{
A matrix with the coordinates of the locations. The first column is the latitude and the second is the longitude.
}
\item{h}{
A vector with bandwith values.
}
\item{nfolds}{
The number of folds to split the data.
}
\item{size}{
A numeric value of the specified range by which blocks are created and training/testing data are separated. This distance should be in metres. For more information see the package \emph{blockCV}.
}
\item{folds}{
If you have the list with the folds supply it here. You can also leave it NULL and it will create folds.
}
}

\details{
The \eqn{\alpha}-transformation is applied to the compositional data and the numerical optimisation is performed for the regression, unless \eqn{\alpha=0}, where the coefficients are available in closed form.
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{runtime}{
The runtime required by the cross-validation.
}
\item{perf}{
A matrix with the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the observed from the fitted values. Each row corresponds to a value of \eqn{\alpha} and each column to a value of h.
}
\item{opt}{
A vector with the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergance, the optimal value of \eqn{\alpha} and h.
}
