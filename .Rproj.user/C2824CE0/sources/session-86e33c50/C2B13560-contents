Spatial k-folds

\description{
Spatial k-folds.
}

\usage{
spat.folds(coords, nfolds = 10, size = 1000)
}

\arguments{
\item{coords}{
A matrix with the coordinates of the locations. The first column is the latitude and the second is the longitude.
}
\item{nfolds}{
The number of spatial folds to create.
}
\item{size}{
A numeric value of the specified range by which blocks are created and training/testing data are separated. This distance should be in metres. If you have big regions you should consider increasing this number. For more information see the package \emph{blockCV}.
}
}

\details{
Folds of data are created based on their coordinates. For more information see the package \bold{blockCV}.
}

\value{
A list with nfolds elements. Each elements contains a list with two elements, the first is the indices of the training set and the second contains the indices of the test set.
